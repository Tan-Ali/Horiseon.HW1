# Horiseon.HW1 Description

The objective of this project was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible.  It is important to remember to leave the code cleaner than you found it when editing someone else's code. The webpage needed to meet a certain criteria including:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
At the end of the project it is required to turn the URL of the deployed application and the URL of the GitHub repository with a README in to Bootcamp Spot.
